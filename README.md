# DevHaven-25
As this is the first ever Hackathon I am Participating in, I would not be able to create any complex projects. I have built a 2D game using the pygame module in Python, and I am efficient in Data Structures and Algorithms, so I have also tried to implement my DSA skills in this project and create a similar snake game using 2D arrays.
Had I got a bit more time in this Hackathon, I would have built multiple 2D games,but for now I am only able to submit the 2D snake game.
Thanks :)
