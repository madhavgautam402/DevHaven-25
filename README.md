# DevHaven-25
As this is the first-ever Hackathon I am Participating in, I could not create any complex projects. I have built a 2D game using the Python pygame module, and I am proficient in data structures and algorithms, so I have also tried to implement my DSA skills in this project and create a similar snake game using 2D arrays.
Had I got more time in this Hackathon, I would have built multiple 2D games,but for now I am only able to submit the 2D snake game.
I have also attached a demonstration video in this repository, which clearly demonstrates how my project works.
Thanks :)
