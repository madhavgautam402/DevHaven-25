# DevHaven-25
As this is the first ever Hackathon i am Participating in, I would not be able to create any complex projects. I have built a 2D game using the pygame module in Python, and I am a bit efficient in Data Structures and Algorithms, so I have also tried to implement my DSA skill in this project and create a similar snake game using 2D arrays.
Thanks :)
